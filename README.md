# 👋 Hi, I'm Rem (Remuriin)

I'm a beginner Java developer with a focus on game design and modular programming.  
Currently working on my first full project — a Pac-Man-inspired game built with Java Swing.  

---

### 🔧 What I’m learning
- Object-oriented programming (Java)
- Game logic, animations, and UI design
- Sound handling in Java Swing

---

### 🚀 What’s next
Once my first project is complete, I’ll be uploading it here.  
Stay tuned!

### 💬 Connect with me
You can find me here on GitHub as **Remuriin**.  
Always happy to connect and share ideas about game programming.
